# Marketing-Campaign-Performance

## Project Overview  
Our company has been running multiple marketing campaigns across various channels (Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest) to promote our products. We have collected detailed data on daily ad performance, including metrics like impressions, clicks, spend, conversions, and engagement (likes, shares, comments). This project aims to analyze this data to gain insights into the effectiveness of our campaigns, optimize our ad spend, and improve future marketing strategies.
## Objectives
❖	Evaluate Campaign Performance: Assess the overall performance of each campaign in terms of reach, engagement, and conversions.
❖	Channel Effectiveness: Determine which advertising channels are driving the best results.
❖	Geographical Insights: Identify the cities that show the highest engagement and conversion rates.
❖	Device Performance: Understand how ads perform across different devices.
❖	Ad-Level Analysis: Analyze the performance of individual ads to identify high-performing creatives.
❖	ROI Calculation: Calculate the return on investment (ROI) for each campaign.
❖	Time Series Analysis: Track the performance trends over time to identify patterns and seasonal effects.
